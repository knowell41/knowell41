### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm "Knowell", Electronics Engineer, working as a full-time Software Developer. I am also a certified Google Cloud professional Data Engineer but never got a chance to do an actual Data Engineering project in GCP. I just want to brag about it. ðŸ¤£
Maybe you need a Data Engineer to cover a few tasks for you. Well, you're in luck! Just ping me. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal private project related to Django and OpenAI's models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science, Deep learning, NLP, and playing with ChatGPT.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a Python-based project related to AI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Electronics, Hardware and Software integrations, and Internet of things, and Machine learning stuff. These are neverending topics for me.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me on my business email emmanuel.pagayonan@erpconsultancy.dev
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play movies in the background while working. Helps me focus. Weird right?
